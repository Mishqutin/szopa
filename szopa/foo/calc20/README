CALC20 - a stylish, programmable calculator!

Your worst christmas gift comes with:
  *A CALC20 calculator with NIGGER v0.3 kernel on-board!
  *Dedicated compilator.
  *Example code written with hatred in mind.

Batteries are NOT INCLUDED! You need these dependencies:
  -Python3.x
  -A computer (may or may not be working. depends on your preferences)
  -Uhh and it won't work on on MS-DOS, but u can try.


How to setup your funny, little toy:
  +`chmod +x ./c20compile` - yo need'a run it with Python, but that's
                             faster.
  +`./c20compile <name-o-ex-prg>` - compile the example program
                                    included within. Idk I forgot. Too
				    much work to ctrl d ls fg whatever
  +Now you see there has been created a new, a bit strange file you
   are unsure about. Don't worry, .BIN is just for aesthetics.
   A simple text file with some array with some random numbers in it.
  +Now you can `chmod +x calc20` or python3 calc20 same as before
   except I didn't tell you last time.

What the hell's wrong with that example program:
  1. Use numpad, best immersion HD make sure yo 3D drivers are updated
  2. Done with updating drivers? Well, then.. Good job!
  3. So you've started the program, seen the intro (nigger) and now
     yo seeing an empty display.
  4. Press a digit from 0-9. Now you your digidig on the screen. Sorry
     you can have only one of those.
  5. Now press either + or - for subtraction and double precision
     fractal exponentation, respectively.
  7. I mean, addition and subtraction :P.
  8. And now's the time for your second chance - press another single
     digit and wait.
  9. Now you see the result! Yay! Press Return, to play again.
  10. ???
  11. Profit.


Now the less fun part... I mean, it's more fun, but only for a little
while, and then it's not so much fun, but it also depends on one's
likelings and other psychological stuff, that I don't care about.

== Trying to program this shit: ==
It's simmilar to assembler, even the name is a bit fammiliar:
"orgasm c20 language".
General rules: separate argument's with space, commas, newlines,
they are all translated into single spaces at the end and the
white space is removed.
Colons (;) (I think that's the name) are completely ignored, removed.
Use them how you want, even inside a command.

Please look at the compilers code for a list of commands and also
look at the c20 code.

Examples:

`print 123`
> displays 123

`print 1
 print 2`
> displays 12

`mov #100, 69
 print #100`
> displays 69

`mov #100, #102`
> RAM[100] = RAM[102]

`mov 1 2`
> Compilation error.

```
some_label:
key #1000

cmp #1000, 20
je some_label
```
> if yo press Return it repeats.

```
kurva
```
> Compilation error - no such code.

```
je chuj
```
> Compiler crash.

```
m;;ov;;
#;100      1;;
```
> Same as mov 100, 1
